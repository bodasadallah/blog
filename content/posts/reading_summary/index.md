# You and your Research

> https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html

## Main Ideas
- Commit to your idea
- Ask yourself: What are the important problems in my field?
- Communicate with the bright minds
- Ask the important questions
- Closed door, or open door
  - when you work with door closed
    - you work harder
    - you work on the wrong thing
  - open door working
    - get many interruptions
    - get important clues
  - My take on this is we should keep an open mind about what other people are doing and where the research is heading
