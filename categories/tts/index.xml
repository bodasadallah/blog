&lt;p>TTS can be viewed as a sequence-to-sequence mapping problem; from a sequence of discrete symbols
(text) to a real-valued time series (speech signals). A typical TTS pipeline has two parts; 1)
text analysis and 2) speech synthesis. The text analysis part typically includes a number of natural
language processing (NLP) steps, such as sentence segmentation, word segmentation, text normalization,
part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion. It takes a word
sequence as input and outputs a phoneme sequence with a variety of linguistic contexts. The speech
synthesis part takes the context-dependent phoneme sequence as its input and outputs a synthesized
speech waveform.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TTS Research</title><link>https://bodasadalla98.github.io/blog/text_to_speech/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Boda Sadallah</author><guid>https://bodasadalla98.github.io/blog/text_to_speech/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="tts">TTS&lt;/h3>
