<h4 id="p-value">P value:</h4>
<pre><code>determines if some numbers have realationship, or they are random (whether they are independat or dependant)

suppose we have the temp and R (transmitity) values of a 100 cities in China and we want to see if there's a relation between them.

then we generate many sets of random numbers for each parameter then we calculate the P value which would tell us what's the percentage this slope  is a random, and that ther's no relation

A P-value is the probability of an observed result  assuming that the null hypothesis (there's no relation ) is true


PS: P-value also is dependant on the size of the set u used, so they don't measure the importance of the result.

so don't use P-values

If the P value is &gt; 0.5 then we sure that these daata have no ralation, and if  the p-value is so small, then there's a chance that the data have a relation
